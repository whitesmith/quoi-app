## Setup
1. Run `npm install`
2. Start server with `webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
3. Access http://localhost:8080/public/

## DevTools

The following steps are not required, but I strongly recommend you to install this:

1. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi
2. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd

You'll have two new tabs in Chrome for React and Redux. They're awesome.
